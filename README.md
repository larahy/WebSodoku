SODOKU WEB VERSION -- Week 5 Challenge -- set by @shadchnev

======================
  
Week 5 at Makers Academy and we're going global! Our first week using front end technologies. I learnt to use Sinatra, rack-flash, ERB and CSS, as well as Heroku deployment including add-ons such as New Relic. You can see my Sudoku Solver online at http://sleepy-lowlands-3524.herokuapp.com/
